# Tags in dbt

Tags in dbt are a flexible way to organize and manage your dbt resources, such as models, seeds, snapshots, and tests. By assigning tags, you can group related resources and perform actions on them collectively.

## How to Use Tags

You can add tags to a resource in its `.yml` or `.sql` file:

```yaml
models:
    - name: my_model
        tags: ['finance', 'monthly']
```

Or directly in the model file:

```sql
-- models/my_model.sql
{{ config(tags=['finance', 'monthly']) }}
SELECT ...
```

## Common Use Cases

- **Selective runs:** Run or test only resources with a specific tag.
    ```bash
    dbt run --select tag:finance
    dbt test --select tag:monthly
    ```
- **Deployment management:** Deploy only certain tagged models in different environments.
- **Documentation:** Tags appear in dbt docs, helping with resource discovery.

## Best Practices

- Use consistent naming conventions for tags.
- Combine tags with selectors for complex workflows.
- Regularly review and update tags as your project evolves.
