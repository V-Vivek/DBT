# Source Freshness Test in dbt

Source freshness tests in dbt help ensure that your data sources are up-to-date and not stale. This is crucial for maintaining data quality and reliability in analytics workflows.

## How It Works

- **Definition**: You define freshness criteria (like maximum acceptable age) for your sources in the `sources:` section of your `schema.yml` file.
- **Execution**: Run `dbt source freshness` to check if the data in your sources meets the defined freshness criteria.
- **Alerts**: If the data is older than the allowed threshold, dbt will flag the source as stale.

## Example Configuration

```yaml
sources:
    - name: raw
        tables:
            - name: orders
                freshness:
                    warn_after: {count: 12, period: hour}
                    error_after: {count: 24, period: hour}
                loaded_at_field: created_at
```

## Benefits

- **Data Trust**: Ensures stakeholders are working with recent data.
- **Automation**: Integrates with CI/CD for automated monitoring.
- **Transparency**: Provides clear reporting on data staleness.

## Commands

```bash
dbt source freshness
```

This command checks all configured sources and reports their freshness status.
