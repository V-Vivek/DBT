# Custom Singular Tests in DBT

DBT allows you to define custom tests to validate your data. Singular tests are custom SQL queries that return failing records. If the query returns any rows, the test fails.

## Creating a Custom Singular Test

1. **Create a test file** in the `tests` directory (e.g., `tests/my_custom_test.sql`).
2. **Write a SQL query** that returns rows when the test should fail.

### Example: Check for Null Values in a Column

Suppose you want to ensure that the `email` column in the `users` table is never null.

**File:** `tests/no_null_emails.sql`
```sql
SELECT *
FROM {{ ref('users') }}
WHERE email IS NULL
```

## Running the Test

Singular tests are automatically discovered by dbt and do not need to be declared in your model's `.yml` file. As long as your custom test SQL file is placed in the `tests` directory, dbt will find and run it when you execute `dbt test`.

You can run all tests or a specific test using:

```sh
dbt test
# or to run a specific test file
dbt test --select no_null_emails
```

## Summary

Custom singular tests in DBT are flexible and allow you to enforce data quality rules specific to your project by writing simple SQL queries.
