# `dbt_project.yml` File

The `dbt_project.yml` file is the main configuration file for a dbt project. It defines project-level settings, such as the project name, version, model configurations, and paths for models, seeds, snapshots, and tests.

## Key Sections

- **name**: The name of your dbt project.
- **version**: The version of your project.
- **profile**: The name of the profile in `profiles.yml` to use for database connections.
- **model-paths**: Directories where dbt looks for model files.
- **seed-paths**: Directories for seed CSV files.
- **test-paths**: Directories for custom tests.
- **analysis-paths**: Directories for analysis files.
- **target-path**: Directory where compiled SQL and artifacts are stored.
- **models**: Model-specific configurations, such as materializations and tags.

## Example

```yaml
name: my_dbt_project
version: '1.0'
profile: my_profile

model-paths: ["models"]
seed-paths: ["seeds"]
test-paths: ["tests"]
analysis-paths: ["analysis"]
target-path: "target"

models:
  my_dbt_project:
    +materialized: view
```
## Model Configurations

Within the `models` section of `dbt_project.yml`, you can specify configurations that apply to all models, specific subfolders, or individual models. Common configurations include:

- **materialized**: Defines how dbt builds the model (`view`, `table`, `incremental`, or `ephemeral`).
- **schema**: Sets a custom schema for models.
- **alias**: Changes the name of the model in the database.
- **tags**: Adds tags to models for grouping or selection.
- **persist_docs**: Controls whether dbt persists model descriptions as database comments.
- **enabled**: Enables or disables specific models.
- **pre-hook/post-hook**: SQL statements to run before or after model execution.

### Example

```yaml
models:
  my_dbt_project:
    +materialized: table
    +schema: analytics
    +tags: ['core', 'finance']
    +persist_docs:
      relation: true          # Persist model-level descriptions
      columns: true           # Persist column-level descriptions
        
    # Configs specific for models present under staging sub-folder
    staging:
      +materialized: view
      +enabled: false
```

You can nest configurations to apply them to folders or override them for specific models. Prefixing with `+` applies the config to all models in that path.


## Table Expiration
You can configure automatic table expiration for models in your `dbt_project.yml` file. This is especially useful in data warehouses like BigQuery, where you may want tables to be deleted after a certain period to manage storage costs.

Set the `+hours_to_expiration` config to specify when a table should expire. For example, to set tables to expire 7 days after creation:

```yaml
models:
    my_dbt_project:
        +materialized: table
        +hours_to_expiration: 604800  # Expire after 7 days (in seconds)
```

> **Note:** Table expiration is supported in some warehouses (like BigQuery). Check your adapter's documentation for compatibility and config options.

## Notes

- The `dbt_project.yml` file must be in the root directory of your dbt project.
- Changes to this file may require rerunning dbt commands to take effect.
