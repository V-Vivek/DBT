# Seeds in dbt

**Seeds** in dbt are CSV files that you can use as data sources in your dbt project. They are useful for loading static data, reference tables, or small datasets that don't change often.

## How Seeds Work

- Place your CSV files in the `/seeds` directory of your dbt project.
- dbt will create tables in your data warehouse from these CSV files when you run `dbt seed`.
- You can then reference these tables in your models just like any other table.

## Example

Suppose you have a CSV file named `country_codes.csv`:

```csv
country_code,country_name
US,United States
CA,Canada
IN,India
```

Place this file in the `seeds` folder: `seeds/country_codes.csv`.

Run the following command to load the seed data:

```bash
dbt seed
```

This will create a table (e.g., `country_codes`) in your data warehouse.

You can now use this table in your models:

```sql
-- models/example_model.sql
select
    user_id,
    cc.country_name
from {{ ref('users') }} u
left join {{ ref('country_codes') }} cc
    on u.country_code = cc.country_code
```
## Seed YAML File

You can add a YAML file to document and configure your seeds. Place a `.yml` file (e.g., `country_codes.yml`) in the same directory as your seed CSV.

Example `country_codes.yml`:

```yaml
version: 2

seeds:
    - name: country_codes
        # Column names, descriptions, and tests can all be done as normal
        description: "Reference table for country codes and names."
        columns:
            - name: country_code
                description: "The ISO country code."
            - name: country_name
                description: "The full country name."
        
        # If you want to enforce datatypes, you can do so here
        # Otherwise, BigQuery will do it for you!
        config:
            column_types:
                country_code: string
                country_name: string
```

- The `columns` section documents each column in your seed.
- The `config` section lets you specify column types or other seed-specific settings.
- dbt uses this YAML file for documentation and to apply configurations when seeding.

## Summary

Seeds are a simple way to manage and load static data into your dbt project, making it easy to join or reference in your models.
