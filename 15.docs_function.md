# Using the `docs` Function in DBT

The `docs` function in DBT lets you reference reusable documentation blocks for models, columns, or other resources. This helps keep your documentation organized and consistent across your project.

## Defining Documentation Blocks

Documentation blocks are written in `.md` files and can be placed anywhere in your DBT project (can be placed in a sub-directory named `documents` inside `models` directory).

**Example: `my_table_doc.md`**
```jinja
{% docs my_table_doc %}
This table contains customer order data, including order IDs, customer IDs, and order amounts.
{% enddocs %}
```

## Referencing Documentation in YAML

You can reference a documentation block in your model's YAML file using the `doc` function:

```yaml
models:
    - name: orders
        description: "{{ doc('my_table_doc') }}"
        columns:
            - name: order_id
                description: "Unique identifier for each order."
            - name: customer_id
                description: "ID of the customer who placed the order."
```

## Benefits

- **Reusability:** Write documentation once and reference it in multiple places.
- **Organization:** Keep your documentation modular and easy to maintain.
- **Consistency:** Ensure descriptions are uniform across your DBT project.

**Tip:** Use meaningful names for your documentation blocks to make them easy to find and reference.
