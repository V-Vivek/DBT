## Indirect selection
You can use the following modes to configure the behavior when performing indirect selection (with eager mode as the default).

### Eager mode
- This is the default mode. It will run all the tests associated with the selected model and the indirectly selected models.
- It will also run the tests associated with the models that are indirectly selected by the selected model.
- This mode is useful when you want to ensure that all related models are tested, even if they are not directly selected.

### Buildable mode
- This mode will only run tests associated with the selected model and the models that are directly selected by it.
- It will not run tests for models that are indirectly selected.
- This is useful when you want to focus on the selected model and its direct dependencies without running tests for all indirectly related models.

### Cautious mode
- This mode will run tests for the selected model only
- It will not run tests for any other models, whether they are directly or indirectly related.
- This is useful when you want to isolate the tests for a specific model without considering any dependencies
- This mode is particularly useful for debugging or when you want to ensure that the selected model's tests are independent of others.

### Empty mode
- This mode will not run any tests at all.
- It is useful when you want to skip the test execution entirely, perhaps for a specific configuration or when you are not ready to run tests.


### Example usage
```sh
# Run tests in eager mode
dbt test -s my_model --indirect-select eager
# This will run all tests for my_model and any models it indirectly selects.

# Run tests in buildable mode
dbt test -s my_model --indirect-select buildable
# This will run tests for my_model and its direct dependencies only.

# Run tests in cautious mode
dbt test -s my_model --indirect-select cautious
# This will run tests for my_model only.

# Run tests in empty mode
dbt test -s my_model --indirect-select empty
# This will skip all tests and not run any.
```
