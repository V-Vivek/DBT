# Frequently Used DBT Commands
## `dbt init`
Initializes a new dbt project in your current directory. This command creates the necessary folder structure and sample files to help you get started.

**Example:**
```
dbt init my_new_project
```
This will create a new directory called `my_new_project` with all the basic dbt files and folders.
## `dbt run`
Runs all models in your project (or a subset, if specified). This command compiles your SQL files and runs them against your data warehouse, creating tables or views as defined.

**Example:**
```
dbt run
```
You can run a specific model:
```bash
dbt run --select my_model
# or
dbt run -s my_model
```

## `dbt test`
Executes tests defined in your project, such as schema or data tests, to ensure data quality and integrity.

**Example:**
```
dbt test
```
Run tests for a specific model:
```
dbt test --select my_model
```

## `dbt build`
Runs models, tests, snapshots, and seeds in the correct order. This is a newer, all-in-one command.

**Example:**
```
dbt build
```

## `dbt seed`
Loads CSV files from your `data` directory into your data warehouse as tables. Useful for static or reference data.

**Example:**
```
dbt seed
```

## `dbt docs generate` and `dbt docs serve`
- `dbt docs generate` builds documentation for your project.
- `dbt docs serve` launches a local web server to view the docs.

**Example:**
```
dbt docs generate
dbt docs serve
```

## `dbt snapshot`
Executes snapshot logic to capture slowly changing dimensions.

**Example:**
```
dbt snapshot
```

**Tip:**  
You can always see all available commands and options with:
```
dbt --help
```

**Gotcha:**  
- Be careful with `dbt run` and `dbt build` in production, as they can overwrite tables/views.
- Use `--select` and `--exclude` to target specific models and avoid unnecessary runs.
