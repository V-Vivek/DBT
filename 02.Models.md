# Models in DBT

## What are Models?
In DBT (Data Build Tool), models are SQL files that define transformations on your raw data. These transformations are used to create clean, organized and analytics-ready datasets.

## How Models Work
1. **SQL Queries**: Each model is a SQL file that contains a query to transform data.
2. **Materializations**: Models can be materialized as tables, views or incremental tables in your database.
3. **Dependencies**: Models can reference other models, creating a dependency graph.

## Types of Materializations
- **View**: Creates a database view for the model.
- **Table**: Creates a physical table in the database.
- **Incremental**: Updates only new or changed data in the table.

## Example
```sql
-- models/orders.sql
WITH customer_orders AS (
    SELECT 
        customer_id,
        COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders
    FROM raw.orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT * 
FROM customer_orders;
```

## Best Practices
- Use meaningful names for models.
- Organize models into folders for clarity.
- Leverage `ref()` to manage dependencies.

## Benefits
- Simplifies data transformation.
- Promotes modular and reusable SQL.
- Enables version control for data pipelines.
