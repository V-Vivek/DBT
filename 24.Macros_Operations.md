# Operations Macros in dbt

Operations macros in dbt are special macros that allow you to execute arbitrary SQL statements, such as DML or administrative commands, which are not directly supported by dbt models or seeds. They are typically used for tasks like granting permissions, running maintenance commands, or performing data quality checks.

## How to Use Operations Macros

You define an operations macro in your `macros/` directory, then invoke it using the `dbt run-operation` command.

### Example: Granting Select Privileges

**Define the macro in `macros/grant_select.sql`:**

```jinja
{% macro grant_select(schema_name, table_name, role) %}
    grant select on {{ schema_name }}.{{ table_name }} to role {{ role }};
{% endmacro %}
```

**Run the macro from the command line:**

```sh
dbt run-operation grant_select --args '{"schema_name": "analytics", "table_name": "users", "role": "analyst"}'
```

This will execute the SQL to grant select privileges on the `analytics.users` table to the `analyst` role.

## Best Practices

- Use operations macros for tasks outside the scope of dbt models.
- Always test your macros in a development environment before running in production.
- Document your macros for maintainability.
