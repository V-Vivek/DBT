# DBT Basic Folder Structure

A typical dbt project has the following folder structure:

```
my_dbt_project/
├── models/
├── snapshots/
├── seeds/
├── tests/
├── macros/
├── analyses/
├── data/
├── target/
├── logs/
├── dbt_project.yml
└── packages.yml
```

## Folder and File Purposes

- **models/**  
    Contains SQL files that define your data models (tables/views). This is where most of your transformation logic lives.

    Within the **models/** directory, it is common to organize SQL files into subfolders to reflect different layers of your data transformation pipeline:

    - **staging/**  
        Contains models that clean and prepare raw source data. These models typically mirror your source tables and standardize formats, naming, and data types.

    - **intermediate/**  
        Holds models that perform further transformations on staged data. These are used for logic that doesn't fit cleanly into staging or marts, such as joining multiple staging tables or applying business rules.

    - **marts/**  
        Contains your final business-facing models, often organized by business domain (e.g., `core/`, `finance/`, `marketing/`). These models are typically used directly by analytics and reporting tools.

    - **documents/**  
        (Optional) Used for markdown or documentation files related to your models, such as model descriptions or data dictionaries.

    Organizing models into these subfolders helps maintain a clear, scalable, and maintainable project structure, making it easier to understand data flow and collaborate with your team.

- **snapshots/**  
    Stores snapshot definitions for slowly changing dimensions (SCDs), allowing you to track changes to records over time.

- **seeds/**  
    Holds CSV files that dbt can load as tables into your data warehouse. Useful for static or reference data.

- **tests/**  
    Custom schema and data tests to validate your model's data quality.

- **macros/**  
    Contains reusable Jinja macros to simplify and standardize SQL logic across your project.

- **analyses/**  
    For ad-hoc queries and analyses that aren't part of your main models.

- **data/**  
    (Optional) Used for sample data or additional resources.

- **target/**  
    Output directory for compiled SQL files and artifacts generated by dbt runs.

- **logs/**  
    Stores logs generated during dbt runs for debugging and auditing.

- **dbt_project.yml**  
    Main configuration file for your dbt project (project name, version, model paths, etc.).

- **packages.yml**  
    Lists external dbt packages your project depends on.

- **profiles.yml**  
    Located outside your dbt project directory (typically in the `~/.dbt/` folder), this file stores connection details and credentials for your data warehouse. It defines how dbt connects to different environments (development, staging, production) and manages target configurations securely.

This structure helps organize your analytics workflow, making it easier to manage, test, and collaborate on data transformations.
