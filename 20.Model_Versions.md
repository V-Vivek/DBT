# dbt Model Versions

dbt model versioning allows you to manage changes to your models over time, supporting smooth transitions and backward compatibility.

## Key Concepts

- **latest_version**: Specifies the most recent version of a model.
- **versions**: Lists all available versions of a model.

## Example: Model Versioning in YAML

```yaml
version: 2

models:
    - name: orders
      latest_version: 2
      columns:
        - name: customer_id
          description: This is the primary key
          data_type: int
      
        - name: country_name
          description: Where this customer lives
          data_type: varchar

        # Declare the versions, and highlight the diffs
      versions:
        - v: 1
        # Matches what's above -- nothing more needed
        
        - v: 2
        # Removed a column -- this is the breaking change!
        columns:
        # This means: use the 'columns' list from above, but exclude country_name
          - include: all
            exclude: [country_name]
```

## Usage

- Use `latest_version` to indicate which version should be used by default.
- Use `include` and `exclude` to control which columns are present in each version.
- This allows for backward compatibility while also enabling new features or changes in the model structure.
