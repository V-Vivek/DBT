# Model Access Levels in DBT

DBT supports different access levels for models to control their visibility and usage within a project:

- **Private**: The model can only be referenced by other models in the same directory (or subdirectory). This is useful for staging or intermediate models that shouldn't be used elsewhere.
- **Protected**: The model can be referenced by models in the same package, but not by models in other packages. This is suitable for models that are shared within a team or project but not meant for external use.
- **Public**: The model can be referenced by any model in any package. Use this for models that are intended to be widely used as sources of truth.

You can set the access level in your model's `.yml` file:

```yaml
models:
    - name: my_private_model
        access: private
    - name: my_protected_model
        access: protected
    - name: my_public_model
        access: public
```

# Model Groups

Model groups allow you to organize models into logical collections. This is useful for managing permissions, documentation, and governance.
## Creating and Defining Groups

Groups are defined in your project's `groups.yml` file. Each group can include a description and specify owners or maintainers for governance purposes. This helps clarify the purpose of each group and who is responsible for its models.

Example `groups.yml`:

```yaml
groups:
    - name: finance
        description: Models related to financial reporting and analysis.
        owner:
            name: Finance Analytics Team
            email: finance-team@example.com
    - name: analytics
        description: Models used for customer and product analytics.
        owner:
            name: Analytics Team
            email: analytics@example.com
```

After defining groups, you can assign models to them in your model `.yml` files as shown below.
You can assign a model to a group in your `.yml` file:

```yaml
models:
    - name: sales_summary
        group: finance
    - name: customer_churn
        group: analytics
```

# Example Usage

Suppose you have the following models:

- `stg_orders` (private): Used only for staging order data.
- `int_orders` (protected): Used for intermediate transformations, accessible within the package.
- `orders_summary` (public): Final model, accessible by all packages.

```yaml
models:
    - name: stg_orders
        access: private
        group: staging
    - name: int_orders
        access: protected
        group: transformation
    - name: orders_summary
        access: public
        group: reporting
```

**How to use:**

- Other models in the `staging` group can reference `stg_orders`.
- Models in the same package can reference `int_orders`.
- Any model in any package can reference `orders_summary`.

This structure helps enforce best practices and maintain clear boundaries in your DBT project.
