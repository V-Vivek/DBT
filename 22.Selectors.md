# Selectors in dbt

Selectors in dbt are used to specify which resources (models, seeds, snapshots, etc.) should be included or excluded when running dbt commands. They help you target specific parts of your project efficiently.

## Types of Selectors

### 1. Model Name Selector
Selects resources by their name.

```bash
dbt run --select my_model
```

### 2. Tag Selector
Selects resources by tags defined in their config.

```bash
dbt run --select tag:nightly
```

### 3. Path Selector
Selects resources by their file path.

```bash
dbt run --select path:models/staging/
```


### 4. Parent/Child Selector
Selects resources upstream or downstream of a given resource.

- **Children (downstream):**
    ```bash
    dbt run --select my_model+
    ```
- **Parents (upstream):**
    ```bash
    dbt run --select +my_model
    ```


### 5. Multiple Selectors
Combine selectors for more complex targeting.

```bash
dbt run --select tag:nightly path:models/marts/
```

## Example: Combining Selectors

```bash
dbt run --select tag:nightly+ --exclude path:models/experimental/
```

This command runs all resources tagged `nightly` and their children, excluding those in the `experimental` folder.
